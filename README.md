## A sample project including a set of useful tools for handling advanced AI systems in Unity 3D.
All code (aside from that written within asset store packages that I forgot to remove, and the Starter Assets Third Person Controller) was written by me.

### Some of the tools include:
+ Dynamic Waypoint Workflow
  + Forget about placing empty game objects around the scene for patrol points.
  + Dynamically add waypoints in the inspector, remove them, and move them around in the scene.
+ Visual FOV Adjustment
  + Visualize and adjust agent's field of view dynamically within the scene view.
+ Modular and Expandable State Machine
  + States are housed within their own script, each containing a start, update, and end method.
  + Agents can be given access to specific states.
  + Easily modifiable and expandable.
